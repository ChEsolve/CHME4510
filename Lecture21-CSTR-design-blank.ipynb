    "You are designing a CSTR, based on pilot plant data from a 5.4 litre reactor with a helical coil heater and a double propeller stirrer. You scale up the design to a 1.5m diameter tank. \n",
    "The reaction is **exothermic** with $\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn} = -24650$ kJ/kmol (approximately independent of temperature), but it is only mildly exothermic and the feed is quite cold so you still need to add heat.\n",
    "The helical coil heater is supplied with steam at 100 ˚C and has a surface area for heat transfer of $A=0.685$ m2. \n",
    "You estimate (using your heat transfer skills) an overall heat transfer coefficient (including fouling, etc.) of $U=6500$ kJ/m2/hr/K.\n",
    "The volume of liquid in the tank is constant $V=5.16$ m3. \n",
    "The reaction is first order ($r_A = -kC_A$) and the reactant A is in aqueous solution.\n",
    "The rate coefficient follows the Arrhenius expression $k=A\\exp{(-E_A / RT)}$ with $A=6.163\\times10^{37}$ /hr and $E_A/R = 30480$ K.\n",
    "The feed is an aqueous solution with concentration $C_{A0} = 10$ kmol/m3, at temperature $T_0=300$ K and flow rate $v_0=2.84$ m3/hr.\n",
    "The density and heat capacity of the solution (in the feed and the reactor) are just like water: $\\rho=1000$ kg/m3 and $c_{p}=4.19$ kJ/kg/K.\n",

    "If you express the equations as $f_1(T)=0$ and $f_2(C_A)=0$ then you can solve them using a nonlinear equation solver (e.g. [scipy.optimize.root](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html), but it may be hard to find all the roots this way without knowing what to use as an initial guess; a graphical method (section 12.5 of the textbook) will help you find them, and give you a better understanding of what is going on (e.g. plot heat removed or absorbed vs $T$ and heat released vs $T$ on the same graph, like figure 12-14 on p.~560). An alternative would be to plot the energy balance and the mole balance both on a graph of conversion versus temperature (like figure E12-3.2A on p. 556) but the former suggestion makes it easiest to reason about the stability of the multiple steady states.\n",
    "You should find a stable root around $T=360$~K and $C_A=0.4$ kmol/m\\3, which represents a conversion of $X=\\frac{10-0.4}{10}=0.96$. \n"
