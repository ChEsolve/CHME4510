# CHME4510
Materials for my undergraduate course on Chemical Engineering Kinetics and Reactor Design at Northeastern University.
Mostly (or entirely?) Jupyter Notebooks for Python 2.7.


Much material is borrowed or remixed & modded from the MOOC "[Practical Numerical Methods with Python](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall)" by L. Barba, also on GitHub as [numerical-mooc](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc).
